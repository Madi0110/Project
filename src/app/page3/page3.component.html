  <h4>Stadium</h4>
  <p>
    Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. It was originally used by Everton before the club
    moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.Left with an empty ground,
    Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium
    at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.

    The Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment
    initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1â€“0.In 1906 the banked
    stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.The hill was
    the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment
    died, many of them from Liverpool. At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the
    largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but
    Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football
    grounds
